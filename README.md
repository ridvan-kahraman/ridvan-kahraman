## 🎯 About

I come from a strong background in electronics and engineering education, with over 10 years of experience teaching and mentoring in technical fields. In the past few years, I’ve transitioned into software and data analytics, applying tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau to solve engineering problems more intelligently.
<br><br>
Currently, I design PLC-based control systems for firefighting vehicles, focusing on real-time automation and SIL2-compliant safety protocols. My work bridges hands-on engineering, industrial automation, and smart software solutions for mission-critical environments.
