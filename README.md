# Ridvan Kahraman – From Field to Firmware 🔥
## Software Developer | Smart Automation | Problem Solver

## 🎯 About

I come from a strong background in electronics and engineering education, with over a decade of teaching and mentoring experience. In recent years, I’ve transitioned into software and data, using tools like Codesys, Structured Text, Python, SQL, and Tableau to approach engineering problems with both logic and clarity.

Today, I design PLC-based automation systems for firefighting vehicles — where code, control, and safety must work in sync and fail safely. My work lives at the intersection of hands-on engineering and smart, mission-critical software. And somewhere in between, I write about what connects systems and souls.
