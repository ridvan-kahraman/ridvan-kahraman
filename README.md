<br><br><br>

## 🎯 About

With a strong background in electronics education and hands-on engineering, I transitioned into the software world to build smarter, safer, and more efficient systems.
My experience spans over 10 years in engineering education, 3+ years in IT, and over a year in data analytics using Python, SQL, and Tableau.
<br><br>
Today, I work at the intersection of industrial automation, real-time control systems, and field-tested engineering.
I design PLC-based control systems for firefighting vehicles, integrate safety protocols, and develop intelligent solutions for mission-critical environments.
